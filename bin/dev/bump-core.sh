# Moves this extension to another SEOCart commit: seocart-core.env and every workflow's
# @<commit> together, so the two never disagree. The work is done by SEOCart's own script, in
# the SEOCart checkout beside this one, which must already have the commit
# (git -C ../seocart fetch).

# Usage: sh bin/dev/bump-core.sh <commit>
